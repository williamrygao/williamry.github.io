# To Composer Toby Driver
###### January 2025

My attempt at an Oulipian ritual, changing one word of each previous sentence until it retrieves another meaning. The first and last lines are respectively the first and last lyrics of Toby Driver/Kayo Dot's Frankenstein, *Hubardo*. Thank you Toby Driver for ensuring they contained the same number of words.

The eye of Leviathan was swept from the sea. <br>
The reverie of Leviathan was swept from the sea. <br>
The reverie of Leviathan was hawked from the sea. <br>
The reverie of Leviathan was hawked from the periphery. <br>
The reverie of Leviathan was hawked from departing periphery. <br>
Gita's reverie of Leviathan was hawked from departing periphery. <br>
Gita's reverie of Leviathan was hawked from departing periphery. <br>
To enchant the lonely, to love and to die.
