# Say hi!
<p class="introduction">I'm always eager to discuss my work, even (especially) if I don’t yet know you! To leave comments, corrections, feedback, quips, perjuries, propaganda, threats, dust, arguments, or opinions on anything contained or not contained within this site, you are most encouraged to do so by email: wimrygao[at]gmail[dot]com. I check my email more than I would like to, and typically respond within three days. If I’m drowning in endless trivia, I might forget—in this case, feel free to poke me! Below are some Things that have recently pollluted my mind, which you may find convenient as talking points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://store.deepvellum.org/products/schattenfroh" target="_blank">Schattenfroh by Michael Lentz</a>. A <a href="https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/2019/02/01/schattenfroh-by-michael-lentz/" target="_blank">review by Andrei at The Untranslated</a> was enough to convince me to pre-order the English translation, but I cripplingly lack the ability to extend waking hours, the conversance in the basics of Kabbalistic teachings, the knowledge of the history of the German Reformation and Peasants’ War, the advanced understanding of the mechanics of the printing process in the 16th century, andonandonandon of Lentz's ideal reader. So if you could enlighten me with one or more of these mutations, or if you simply wish to wallow in our mutual insufficiency, please do.

        Jets; in particular <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/jet+bundle" target="_blank">jet bundles</a>. I know vector bundles up to some sophistication — admittedly in the context of topological K-theory and not differential geometry. However I fail miserably to develop any ounce of intuition about jets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Weyl+algebra" target="_blank">Weyl algebras</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+group" target="_blank">quantum groups</a>, or anything representation theory. In preparation for a summer research excursion, I want to amass every perspective possible on these topics.

    <li>
        <a href="https://blackcountrynewroad.bandcamp.com/track/turbines-pigs-live-at-bush-hall" target="_blank">Turbines/Pigs by Black Country, New Road</a>. I'm quite okay with the obvious interpretations (abortion,  lead vocalist Isaac Wood's departure from the band, post-breakup rebirth, Matthew 7:6, various allusions to their other songs) but I hardly see the thread unifying all these ideas, which I'm convinced exists.
    </li>
    <li> Is there a better way to <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/Rota.pdf" target="_blank">teach undergraduate differential equations</a>? Every undergraduate ODEs course in the world, as far as I am aware, is torn apart on one end by tedious computations of general solutions to linear systems, and on the other hand an interesting but near-impossible-given-the-prerequisites theory of existence and uniqueness. Why not abolish the entire course and relegate the former to first-year linear algebra, the latter to real analysis? Both linear algebra and real analysis courses often struggle to stretch the material across an entire semester, so why not motivate those tedious Jordan form computations and those magical results of uniform convergence with brief digressions to differential equations?
