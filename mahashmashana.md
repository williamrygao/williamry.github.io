# Knowing I didn't go nearly far enough.
The best part about Father John Misty releasing what could conceivably be the best
album he'll ever make in time for my finals is having a sandpit for all the
excellent ideas that occur to me during my pre-exam delirium. Because music is much
more poignant when it's anchored to salient experiences, and music criticism is
much more compelling when it's tormented by the critic's weltanschauung.

My most considerable shift in perspective this year came from understanding that
living takes more and more energy, and that energy will only become more and more
scarce. I've always known this implicitly, but it's only recently had a direct 
impact on my lived experience in a way that's impossible to ignore.

The past few years of my life have followed a rather unsettling pattern (at least
academically. Socially, too much has changed for me to see the pattern right now,
but I don't doubt it's there). I commit to a seemingly insurmountable scheme.
A courseload that should surely be my ruin. A project that I am vastly
underqualified to undertake (viz. the website you're reading). As if by divine
intervention, I emerge unscathed. Mostly. It's quite possible that this is the result 
of marvelous capitalism bestowing a bounty to all those who work hard. But my very 
overt inner cynic finds it difficult to believe I'm unique in this aspect. And 
(tone-deafly) claims:

*'Working on hard problems' is a modern Sisyphean ritual.*

Now, I can't say something this contrarian without elaborating, and I will do so, 
a little sardonically. Many brilliant (moreso than myself) young people arrive 
prematurely at the conclusion that solving hard, technical problems must be their
modus operandi. I think this brings even more students into computer science and 
engineering than the industry outlook. An obvious source of this misguidance (again, 
I'm screaming at myself here) is validation. The North American education system is 
faultlessly conceived to reward it, and only it. And it doesn't help that it's echoed 
throughout social circles, career advising centres, and job descriptions.

So let's overturn the education system. Let's remove all demand for ambiguous 
skills in all hiring procedures, so that all you need to get hired is a 
hyper-specialized and absurdly long list of all the precise tasks you will do at 
the role. And in the name of honesty, the job must match the description, so your
life will be reduced to a list of tasks. Turn your mind into a machine.

The funny thing is, I don't even know if *that* would change anything. It's easy to 
blame schools and the industry; it's significantly harder (as with every problem 
anyone has ever had) to blame ourselves. What I've realized is that we have the energy.
No matter how infrequently inspiration might strike, we'd all be dead if there was 
none at all.

If I'm being optimistic, we're not all dead. And we're wholly responsible
for choose where to dedicate the little energy we have left. So I'm breaking the
cycle. I don't think that entails abandoning math entirely, but I have abandoned a lot 
of what originally convinced me to do math (stupidity). I've worried far less about 
memorizing every theorem and definition, or solving every exercise in the textbook, and
more about the intuition that makes mathematics so beautiful. Substituting
perfectionism with (post-post-)postmodern maximalism. There's a fragile balance between 
Gelson's and the fallen star, the corporeal and the ethereal. Their metaphysical fusion
is a mystery we all believe in, but cannot reconcile, because it contradicts the most 
basic of our lived experiences. We're deeply offended by its indifference towards us,
so we, like mimes trapped in a glass box, upscale our conquest of all we can see, 
knowing no limits. This dance yields glints of love and truth, but anything found is 
soon lost. Mahāśmaśāna (महामशान) — great cremation ground, all things put going 
thither. It tells the only eternal story: Gilgamesh, Bible, Qu'ran.

That's as good as I can do for the first track, which sets the stage for the rest of
the album. Unraveling it all would defeat the purpose, so I'll just leave my favourite
lyrics from each song:
<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;The aggrieved becomes aggressor and we do it all again.&rdquo;</i> — She Cleans Up.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;I'd forfeit my existence
if someone let me just play with them.&rdquo;</i> — Josh Tillman and the Accidental Dose.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;Oh, magic child, this dream we're born inside feels awful real sometimes, but it's all in your mind.&rdquo;</i> — Mental Health.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;The optimist swears hope dies last, and shoots the lamplight clean from the brakeman's hand.&rdquo;</i> — Screamland.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;In my memory is a show I call the past: I watch and decide just what I would do next.&rdquo;</i> — Being You.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;I followed my dreams and my dreams said to crawl.&rdquo;</i> — I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All.</p>

<p class="introduction"><i>&ldquo;What do you tell the madman who wants to see you dead, when against your will comes wisdom and 40 more years left ahead?&rdquo;</i> — Summer's Gone.</p>

I'm learning to love war, to not become to consumed by the present
and its endless horrors, to take a chance on eternity. I'm not even sure if we're 
biologically wired to know anything other than the present moment. But isn't 
living all about miraculously adjusting our default settings? The ones that sustain the 
belief that your personal reality is the realer than any other (cf. I'm Writing a 
Novel)? Belief in the future, as trivial as it sounds, is the key to conjuring beauty 
in a void.
