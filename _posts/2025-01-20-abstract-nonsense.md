# Abstract Nonsense as a Vessel for Thought
###### January 2025
Within my first quarter at the University of Toronto, I recognized that the most efficient way to whatsess the whatness of a wide variety of fields in mathematics was through the Putnam contest training sessions. Without a hope I was lost but on a measure zero set of enjambments, yet each jambe I could enjambe proved exceedingly worthwhile. The sessions were led by a different (usually tenure-track) professor each week, which seemed the perfect opportunity to witness a day in the life of the working mathematician. Moreover, Ignacio rallied enough optimism to invite me to double the frequency of my training sessions (read: double the magnitude of my imposter syndrome) by joining the advanced training group every Monday in addition to the open sessions. The advanced sessions were concomitantly more exclusive and more egoless. Less like a competition, more like a conference of chimpanzees entrusted with an arsenal of curious thoughts. The most exciting professor I met in this manner was Jacob Tsimerman (sorry Ignacio). In part because he was notably younger than the rest, in other part because he could be the greatest mathematician I'll ever know. He hadn't even looked at the problems to prepare for the session; he, ad libitum, presented flawless solutions to the 8-10 worksheet problems in just a few minutes under the hour. To this day, I'm not sure if this inspires me or shatters my dreams into pieces. Contemplating something in between, I stayed after the session to chat about algebraic number theory and a conjecture of Yves André and Frans Oort which he had recently proven; number fields turned into the category of schemes; and just as I thought I heard God calling my name, he tersely curted *"you'd best master your kindergarten knowledge before getting into that abstract nonsense."* (By kindergarten, he meant undergraduate.) And on that very day, I, out of blindness, admiration, or defiance, decided I would study category theory — the category theorist's term for abstract nonsense.

One year later, I'm taking group theory with the venerable Joe Repka. It's canonical for undergraduate algebra courses to follow the arduously verbose Dummit & Foote, but I, in the secrecy of my bedroom, pledge allegiance the monolith that is *Algebra* by Serge Lang (coincidentally Joe's PhD advisor (incidentally Joe's PhD coadvisor)). Less than eight pages into the book, Lang mentions the automorphism group of an object in a category. Only 45 pages following, Lang formally introduces categories, universal objects, products, fiber products, and coproducts, pullbacks and pushouts, functors covariant and contravariant. Joe likes to mention Serge Lang's audacity and contempt for category theory on occasion, although he is hesitant to share intimate stories of his famously prolific teacher. In the first and second editions of Serge Lang's *Algebra* (unfortunately I have the distilled third), the unique exercise accompanying the section on homology reads:

<i>&ldquo;Take any book on homological algebra, and prove all the theorems without looking at the proofs in that book.

Homological alebgra was invented by Eilenberg-MacLane. General category theory (i.e. the theory of arrow-theoretic results) is generally known as abstract nonsense (the terminology is due to Steenrod).&rdquo;</i>

In December, the definition of a category is presented in my topology lecture. We need (I use the word *need* very lightly. More likely is this being Dror's attempt to indoctrinate us, and to demolish everyone who dares to flout) it to study the homotopy classes of continuous functions. We don't really use the homotopy category until the very last lecture. And the second hour is allocated to Dror's tirade on the axiom of choice, under the guise of constructing an absurdist limit function defined for any bounded sequence. So we spend three hours on the preliminaries required for the one hour of foolishness. For this precisely, Dror ranks first in my list of nonbelievers in the axiom of choice. Dror's PhD advisor was the equally revered Ed Witten, most celebrated for being the only person who knows how to apply category theory to the physical universe. Witten is said to possess an alien talent for finding obvious those things which would demand from most mathematicians or scientists years of reasoning. Dror insists *"he knew the answer to every question my mortal mind could conceive."* I think Dror suffered from the opposite condition; he could stack the sediment of reasoning underneath even the most obvious of statements. I remember we tediously constructed, with proofs of existence and uniqueness, the subspace, product, metric, and quotient topologies from their universal properties. In our final problem set, I muster a proof that π₁ is a functor from Top∗ to Grp, and memoize it like a poem. Retained as a memory from the heart. (Vervaeke would shudder if he heard this metaphor coming out of my mouth.) Not like my email password or on what day all my problem sets are due; more like my mother's birthday, the voice of a friend, the advice of someone I admire. Clearly, I haven't been a great listener.

Another month passes. I'm studying topological K-theory as part of a supervised reading, so I can now half-proudly use the term category theory without being gunned down by the governing council of higher category theory elitists. Associating a pseudo-abelian category to the category of vector bundles over a topological space dwarfs any category theory I saw in MAT327, which is starting to look a lot like kindergarten. I've drawn more commutative diagrams in seven days than I have in my entire previous life, and I'm blackening pages with accelerating pace. I can feel myself slowly flattening into a cog in the lemma-theorem-corollary-example assembly line. I can only hope mathematics' grand machinery will one day produce a tranquil mind. To answer my prayers, my supervisor says, in our second meeting, something perfect to the effect of *"think of category theory as a way to collect your thoughts."* I suppose my writing this is proof I have been thinking the opposite.

As you can hopefully tell by now, this love letter /  diatribe cares little for the (im)possible real-world implications of category theory. I think any attempts to apply category theory to reality will inherently be forced, and not in the sense of forcing axioms. At most, category theory will yield some elegant corollaries in epistemology or metaphysics. (On the subject of corollaries, a roll is to rally orally.) The hopeful call such endeavours "higher" category theory. The depleted don't call it anything.

An analogy that is unlikely to resonate with anyone except my very self: category theory is the Shostakovich's 15th of math. Shostakovich doesn't discriminate. To his ears, all music is equivalent. And by interpolating history itself, he composed a work tto reach beyond. Not quite death or transcendence, but awfully close. Category theory doesn't discriminate. All math is equivalent. Meta-math; the mathematical study of mathematics itself, commissioning a hope to puncture a hole outo the ontological exterior.

I admit I'm not hopeful. It is true that historically, mathematics has been perhaps the subject of greatest influence on philosophy. But I think those days have gone by. I've seen this metaphysical enquiry attract many aspiring mathematicians to category theory, yet I wonder how many will prevail. With the expectations growing without bound, that number will become ε-small.
