# Abstract Nonsense as a Vessel for Thought
###### January 2025
Within my first quarter at the University of Toronto, I recognized that the most efficient way to whatsess the whatness of a wide variety of fields in mathematics was through the Putnam contest training sessions. Without out a hope I was lost but on a measure zero set of enjambments; each jambe I could enjambe proved exceedingly worthwhile. The sessions were led by a different (usually tenure-track) professor each week, which was a perfect opportunity to understand a day in the life of the working mathematician. Moreover, Ignacio rallied up enough optimism to invite me to double the frequency of my training sessions (thus doubling the magnitude of my imposter syndrome) by joining the advanced training group every Monday in addition to the open sessions. The advanced sessions were both more exclusive and more egoless. The most exciting professor I met in this manner was Jacob Tsimerman (sorry Ignacio). In part because he was notably younger than the rest, in other part because his work seemed the most fascinating, and in the largest part because he hadn't even looked at the problems to prepare for the session. He plainly, ad libitum, presented flawless solutions to the 8-10 worksheet problems in just a few minutes under the hour. To this day, I'm not sure if this inspires me or tears my dreams into pieces. I stayed after the session to chat about algebraic number theory and a conjecture of Yves André and Frans Oort which he had recently proven, number fields turned into the category of schemes, and just as I thought I heard God calling my name, he tersely curted *"you'd best master your kindergarten knowledge before getting into that abstract nonsense."* (By kindergarten, he meant undergraduate.) And on that very day, I, out of blindness or defiance, decided I would study category theory — the category theorist's term for abstract nonsense.

One year later, the definition of a category is presented in my topology lecture. I muster a proof that π₁ is a functor from Top∗ to Grp, and memoize it like a poem. Retained as a memory from the heart. (Vervaeke would shudder if he heard this metaphor coming out of my mouth.) Not like my email password or on what day all my problem sets are due; more like my mother's birthday, the voice of a friend, the advice of someone I admire.

Another month passes. I'm studying topological K-theory as part of a supervised reading, so I can now half-proudly use the term category theory without being gunned down by the governing council of category theory elitists. Proving that the category of vector bundles over a compact space is pseudo-abelian dwarfs any category theory I saw in MAT327, which is starting to look a lot like kindergarten. In our second meeting, my supervisor says something perfect to the effect of *"think of category theory as a way to collect your thoughts."*

I used to find it insurmountably difficult to explain why math is important to me. There was probably a period of several months during which my answer would change with the day. On many occasions, I have caught myself throwing the reduction "math is like art" into another's ear, only to hope they would not ask me to elaborate, because I didn't know how. They almost always did. I think I know how to do it now. Of course, definitions are in demand.

Definition 1.1: Art is the God-given insanity.

Defying mathematical tradition, I will include an argument, reductio ad absurdum, for the adequacy of my definition. Certainly those works that every man would agree to call art are human — the great ones excessively so. But the (im)possibility of art itself cannot possibly be, otherwise as I see it, everything (nothing) could be considered art. The insanity requirement will be more clear from the following:

Definition 1.2: Mathematics is the God-given certainty.

This one is concomitantly more self-explanatory and more arcane.

Mathematics is a great city whose suburbs never cease to grow in chaotic fashion on the surrounding lands, while its center is periodically reconstructed, each time following a clearer plan and a more majestic arrangement, demolishing the old sections with their labyrinthine alleys, in order to launch new avenues to the periphery, always more direct, wider and more convenient.
