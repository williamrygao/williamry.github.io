# Who's Afraid of Thelonious Monk?
###### January 2025

### I. BRILLIANT CORNERS
Upper Owen. December 7, 2024. Ernie and Sonny are
dueling as camaraderie exponentiates, 
introductions overwhelm,

— Est-ce que ton amie parle le français?

To which I respond:

— Non, je ne crois pas.

footwear amasses, Drop Your Shoulders Take A Deep Breath... capitulates, coathangers populate, uncharted corners of the attic surface, the iron cabbagepot inundates and whistles, Please Use Your Assigned Washroom oscillates, the monolith chimes, medical experts prescribe, kitchen knives clamour, daggers unsheath,

— Nothing good ever happens in Bedford, Massachussets!

white flags unfurl, treaties ratify, music and laughter resound, the English alphabet baffles, Cyrillic even more, 

— прощай навсегда.

currency evaporates, accidents enqueue, consequences materialize, plagues bedevil, greed consumes, guilt preoccupies, power oppresses, prayers whisper, candles smother, hours sink, the past tyrannizes, the future looms, and chiefly, love tribalizes.

Their auburn, hooked, tubular windworkers sound in unison. A second duet, drowned by rainways lashing at glass, remains anonymous to all those who are present. In less than a moment, a dozen omniscient eyepairs will stare into the distant distance. They will see the grindstone gearing all to the grovel. Mongers and avenuers alike. Meaning miniaturized and memory meagered. All this will make great boneyard. They will see a world written in lines of code. They will see the Second Optimism Epidemic and life as narrative. They will see the nuclear fusion energy, Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and Biosphere 2 paradigm. They will see the Golden Age of Yellowknife, Korean reunification, dissolution of the Russian Federation, and Nigeria as a global superpower. But no one will see the timid pair, amidst the peripatetic noise of this vegetable world in lockstep, in the nearhere herenow, trudging their inconspicuously steady waltz beneath the sky's gaudy tears.

The sky is blue, I am too. Yet everything now seems clear.

Not much earlier we were sprawling the College Street T&T for a choking hour, during which we would accrue two bags of dumplings, one of which NOPARKING would leave in his bag to fuse into a singleness, and two kilograms of pork belly to complement the one kilogram already in our freezer, which we hadn't thought to defrost before our stats exam. In my defense, I had sprinted out of the Putnam room at 1:26 down one flight of OISE stairs out onto the street looked left center right and left again jaywalked across Bloor glared at my reflection in the mirrors on Devonshire that only exist because of the perennial construction in front of Goldring devoured a pizza slice or two from the Buttery on my way up the stairs to the suite didn't bother taking off my wet boots walked into my Drop Your Shoulders... picked up my exam materials headed for the exam centre in a nearly zero curvature regular line although I didn't cut across the front lawn because it was soaked and I waited a minute at the crosswalk on College, all while feeling relatively content at the two solves I was able to salvage in my just over two hours of sitting in the same room as The Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero, who I deeply admire for being one of the everrare math prodigies who fulfill their potential as a mathematician, as opposed to a quant or domestic terrorist. As the years peel off the distinction grows harder to detect.

Throughout the day, my mind intermittently dreams up a storm.

Washington, DC. The beltway drives me in circles. Brakelights and treadmarks pollute the track ahead — mostly my own. It's been fourty-four days since I last saw another car.

I hurdle past exit 34 for the Archimede-th time. The pedal grows just noticeably heavier each time I pass. Some times my failing eyes show me ghastly sights just before I get to 35. Not too many years ago, I found Vesuvius arriving in a 2012 Jeep Wrangler. The inferno emanated a scream so familiar, accompanied by fracturing glass and a croaking inebriate singing *Les désespérés*. Oddly, but not enough, I was reminded of my father. Every Saturday in that Halifax pub, he used to drown his sorrows in whiskey. Not long thereafter, he met a girl and told her he was going to marry her. He did.

Four years later, I can recall it without wreaking that nosepunching nausea. But as I pass under the railway running parallel to Route 355, I can only sustain the chase of my own tailgate, and pray to Poseidon that anything but a *Wish You Were Here* self-immolation ritual awaits me. My eyes cannot be pressed shut. I, motionless, sight a firing squad, motionless, perched above the turnpike. The gleaming sun conceals the figure staring down the five sets of double-barrels. Yet I understand he is laughing. I hear him say, to me I think, *die zeit kann mich nicht berühren*. My friend once said the same, as he pointed a steak knife under my chin and posed for the frontispiece. Potentially the closest I've been to dying. At the hands of one of those I loved most. Miraculously, I think, they never hear fire.

I stop for gas the next chance I'm given. I always cry at gas stations. I pop open the gas cap. The strange machine swallows my credit card. $100 is all I will allow. My card spits out. I watch the numbers rise, dollars faster than gallons. I remember way back when that wasn't true. Before my odometer stalled at the fateless 80,262. The pump jolts and I replace it. I tighten until click and push the cap closed. I hop back in my car. Back then, you'd worry about your car being hawked soon as you went inside to pay. No machine to gobble up your card, and hope it'll spew it back out. Just a man at the counter to tempt with silly games of fate. But there's no longer any past for me to dwell upon. There's no future in us.

A blaring car horn straightens my steering, a hair away from swerving into a crimson red Forester. A woman and two young girls, I nearly killed.

I thought it impossible to recall her sweet face. I never told her about the sunshine in her smile, and the dark waterfall that spills as the wind meets her hair. She gently tilts her head at me as if to suggest **This Is All Your Fault**. And the Forester leaps off the expressway.

Such becomes the prototype for all hereafter. Circles drive me round the beltway. Days melt into weeks, roads melt into sky, weeks melt into months, my perimeter melts into otherness. Remembrance evades me. All the people I've forgotten and not forgotten soar past, facelessly staring through my vacant eyes at the headrest behind me. As they plunge into the chasm beyond the beltway, I almost hear them pronounce those words I never heard. Like they're clinging to the bluff that it's never too late for these last rites. For the first time, those sweet smiles bear not a hint of the desolation resting beneath. And for the first time, I feel the world listening. And for the first time, I flick my right turn signal with certainty, as if the time is any but the wallowing present. As if all my birthdays have come at once.

Yet no set of circumstances in which I found myself on that hectic day (and I solved A5!) was nearly as interesting as the derailment of my reality induced by the simplest of questions, posed to me in a Romance language upon passing through the keyclutching Please Use Your Assigned Washroom for just the sixth time that day:

— Est-ce qu'elle est votre intérêt?

The answer is a lie, but the saxophones still sing.
