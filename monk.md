# Who's Afraid of Thelonious Monk?
### I. BRILLIANT CORNERS
Upper Owen. December 7, 2024. Ernie and Sonny are
dueling as camaraderie exponentiates, 
introductions overwhelm,

— Est-ce que ton amie parle le français?

— Non, je ne crois pas.

footwear amasses, Drop Your Shoulders Take A Deep Breath... capitulates, coathangers populate, uncharted corners of the attic surface, the iron cabbagepot inundates and whistles, Please Use Your Assigned Washroom oscillates, the monolith chimes, medical experts prescribe, kitchen knives clamour, daggers unsheath,

— Nothing good ever happens in Bedford, Massachussets!

white flags unfurl, treaties ratify, music and laughter resound, the English alphabet baffles, Cyrillic even more, 

— прощай навсегда.

currency evaporates, accidents enqueue, consequences materialize, plagues bedevil, greed consumes, guilt preoccupies, power oppresses, prayers whisper, candles smother, hours sink, the past tyrannizes, the future looms, and chiefly, love tribalizes.

Their auburn, hooked, tubular windworkers sing in unison. A second duet, drowned by the onslaught of rainways licking the glass, remains anonymous to all those who are present. In less than a moment, a dozen omniscient eyepairs will stare into the distant distance. They will see the grindstone gearing all to the grovel. Mongers and avenuers alike. Meaning miniaturized and memory meagered. All this will make boneyard. They will see a world written in lines of code. They will see the Second Optimism Epidemic and life as narrative. They will see the nuclear fusion energy, Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and Biosphere 2 paradigm. They will see the Golden Age of Yellowknife, Korean reunification, dissolution of the Russian Federation, and Nigeria as a global superpower. But no one will see the timid pair, amidst the peripatetic noise of this vegetable world in lockstep, in the nearhere herenow, in their inconspicuously steady waltz beneath the sky's gaudy tears.

The sky is blue, I am too. Yet everything now seems clear.

Not much earlier we were sprawling the College Street T&T for a choking hour, during which we would accrue two bags of dumplings, one of which NOPARKING would leave fusing into one in his schoolbag, and two kilograms of pork belly to complement the one kilogram already in our freezer, which we hadn't thought to defrost before our stats exam. In my defense, I had sprinted out of the Putnam room at 1:16 down one flight of OISE stairs out onto the street looked left center right and left again jaywalked across Bloor glared at my reflection in the mirrors on Devonshire that only exist because of the perennial construction in front of Goldring devoured a pizza slice or two from the Buttery on my way up the stairs to the suite didn't bother taking off my dusty boots walked into my Drop Your Shoulders... picked up my exam materials headed for the exam centre in a nearly zero curvature regular line although I didn't cut across the front lawn because it was wet and I waited a minute at the crosswalk on College, all while feeling relatively content at the two solves I was able to salvage in my just over two hours of sitting in the same room as the Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero, who I greatly admire for being one of the everrare math prodigies who fulfill their potential as a mathematician, as opposed to a quant or domestic terrorist. As the years bleed off the distinction grows harder to detect. Nonetheless, he'll be my ordinary differential equations prof next semester, a fact that terrifies and excites me in this moment, but when the time comes will probably pry apart my ribcage.

Yet no set of circumstances in which I found myself on that hectic day (and I solved A5!) was nearly as interesting as the total collapse of my reality induced by the simplest of questions, posed to me in a Romance language upon passing through the Please Use Your Assigned Washroom for the third time since returning from T&T:

— Est-ce qu'elle est votre intérêt?

The answer is a lie, but the song remains the same.
