# Who's Afraid of Thelonious Monk?
### I. BRILLIANT CORNERS
Upper Owen. December 7, 2024. Ernie and Sonny
dueling as camaraderie exponentiates, 
introductions overwhelm,

— Est-ce que ton amie parle le français?

— Non, je ne crois pas.

footwear amasses, DROP YOUR SHOULDERS TAKE A DEEP BREATH... capitulates, coathangers populate, uncharted corners of the attic surface, the iron cabbagepot inundates and whistles, PLEASE USE YOUR ASSIGNED WASHROOM oscillates, the monolith chimes, medical experts prescribe, kitchen knives clamour, daggers unsheath,

— Nothing good ever happens in Bedford, Massachussets!

white flags unfurl, treaties ratify, music and laughter resound, the English alphabet baffles, Cyrillic even more, currency evaporates, accidents enqueue, greed consumes, Finnegan wakes, guilt preoccupies, power oppresses, the past tyrannizes, the future looms, and chiefly, love tribalizes.

Their auburn, hooked, tubular windworkers sing in unison. A second duet, drowned by the onslaught of rainways licking the glass, remains anonymous to all those who are present. In less than a moment, a dozen omniscient eyepairs will stare into the distant distance. See the grindstone gearing all to the grovel. Mongers and avenuers alike. Meaning miniaturized and memory meagered. All this will make boneyard. See a world written in lines of code. See the Second Optimism Epidemic and life as narrative. See the nuclear fusion energy, Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and Biosphere 2 paradigm. See the Golden Age of Yellowknife, Korean reunification, and the dissolution of the Russian Federation. But no one will see the timid pair, amidst the very peripatetic noise of this vegetable world in lockstep. The nearhere distance, staring them in the eyes, beneath the sky's gaudy tears.

— Est-ce qu'elle est votre intérêt?

The answer is a lie, but the song remains the 
same.
