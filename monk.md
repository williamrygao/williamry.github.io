# Who's Afraid of Thelonious Monk?
### I. BRILLIANT CORNERS
Upper Owen. December 7, 2024. Ernie and Sonny are
dueling as camaraderie exponentiates, 
introductions overwhelm,

— Est-ce que ton amie parle le français?

I respond:

— Non, je ne crois pas.

footwear amasses, Drop Your Shoulders Take A Deep Breath... capitulates, coathangers populate, uncharted corners of the attic surface, the iron cabbagepot inundates and whistles, Please Use Your Assigned Washroom oscillates, the monolith chimes, medical experts prescribe, kitchen knives clamour, daggers unsheath,

— Nothing good ever happens in Bedford, Massachussets!

white flags unfurl, treaties ratify, music and laughter resound, the English alphabet baffles, Cyrillic even more, 

— прощай навсегда.

currency evaporates, accidents enqueue, consequences materialize, plagues bedevil, greed consumes, guilt preoccupies, power oppresses, prayers whisper, candles smother, hours sink, the past tyrannizes, the future looms, and chiefly, love tribalizes.

Their auburn, hooked, tubular windworkers sing in unison. A second duet, drowned by the onslaught of rainways licking the glass, remains anonymous to all those who are present. In less than a moment, a dozen omniscient eyepairs will stare into the distant distance. They will see the grindstone gearing all to the grovel. Mongers and avenuers alike. Meaning miniaturized and memory meagered. All this will make boneyard. They will see a world written in lines of code. They will see the Second Optimism Epidemic and life as narrative. They will see the nuclear fusion energy, Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and Biosphere 2 paradigm. They will see the Golden Age of Yellowknife, Korean reunification, dissolution of the Russian Federation, and Nigeria as a global superpower. But no one will see the timid pair, amidst the peripatetic noise of this vegetable world in lockstep, in the nearhere herenow, in their inconspicuously steady waltz beneath the sky's gaudy tears.

The sky is blue, I am too. Yet everything now seems clear.

Not much earlier we were sprawling the College Street T&T for a choking hour, during which we would accrue two bags of dumplings, one of which NOPARKING would leave in his bag to fuse into a singleness, and two kilograms of pork belly to complement the one kilogram already in our freezer, which we hadn't thought to defrost before our stats exam. In my defense, I had sprinted out of the Putnam room at 1:16 down one flight of OISE stairs out onto the street looked left center right and left again jaywalked across Bloor glared at my reflection in the mirrors on Devonshire that only exist because of the perennial construction in front of Goldring devoured a pizza slice or two from the Buttery on my way up the stairs to the suite didn't bother taking off my wet boots walked into my Drop Your Shoulders... picked up my exam materials headed for the exam centre in a nearly zero curvature regular line although I didn't cut across the front lawn because it was soaked and I waited a minute at the crosswalk on College, all while feeling relatively content at the two solves I was able to salvage in my just over two hours of sitting in the same room as The Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero, who I deeply admire for being one of the everrare math prodigies who fulfill their potential as a mathematician, as opposed to a quant or domestic terrorist. As the years bleed off the distinction grows harder to detect.

Throughout the day, my mind intermittently dreams up a storm.

Washington, DC. The beltway drives me in circles. Brakelights and treadmarks pollute the track ahead. It's been fourty-four days since I last saw another car. A 2012 Forester, carrying a dog, a woman, and two young children. They sang *Les désespérés* just quietly enough to not wake the dog. Modern Scott Walker; she suffered from nephritis and they were en route to the hospital. She croaked as they turned off at exit 34.

Now the two express lanes have been overrun by black SUVs. My failing eyes can no longer distinguish one from another, let alone their make or model. My wavering attention brings me to that ghastly night in Naples. Derby del Sole; Jesús was visiting from la Autónoma. One week before, I hiked out to Stadio San Paolo looking for seats, but amidst my broken Italian squaking the box officer hawked the 200 euros I wafted across his vision and cut my barbaric rage out of his recognition. So on the day of the Derby, we shared stories over wine in the same way we would, every weekend, drown our sorrows in whiskey at that miserable New Haven pub. After an uncountable number of glasses are drained, Jesús steps out the door to a small spectacle of copper pyrotechnics, Vesuvian clangour, equine insignia, and Parthenopian incantations. The *tifosi* have arrived.

I find it hard to recall just what ensued. A slender, clawed arm outstretched, seizing my old friend. I motionlessly observe as he is engulfed by the azure flames, screaming. Another arm anchors itself to mine and drags me towards the inferno. Dagger under my chin, I pray to Poseidon.

A blaring car horn straightens my steering. The same woman and her two children occupy the midnight blue Forester. They've grown older; it's the thirteen year-old girl's turn to die. The mother tilts her head at me as if to suggest **This Is All Your Fault**. She is beautiful — I can barely recall her gentle face, but I know it. As I unearth the diamonds in her eyes, the Forester leaps off the expressway, into dust.

Such becomes the prototype for all hereafter. Days melt into weeks, roads melt into sky, the perimeter of my body melts into otherness. Remembrance evades me. All the people I've forgotten and not forgotten soar past, facelessly staring through my vacant eyes at the headrest behind me. Pronouncing those words I never heard. They cling to the bluff that it's never too late for these last rites. And for the first time, those sweet smiles bear not a hint of the desolation resting beneath. And for the first time, I feel the world listening. And for the first time, I flick my right turn signal with certainty, as if it's any time but the wallowing present. As if all my birthdays have come at once.

Yet no set of circumstances in which I found myself on that hectic day (and I solved A5!) was nearly as interesting as the total collapse of my reality induced by the simplest of questions, posed to me in a Romance language upon passing through the Please Use Your Assigned Washroom for just the sixth time that day:

— Est-ce qu'elle est votre intérêt?

The answer is a lie, but the song remains the same.
